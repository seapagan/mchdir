# TODO

- add the ability to speficy the shell to generate integration code with the
  'install' or `init` command - e.g. `mchdir init zsh` which will override the
  automatic shell detection.
- add support for more shells. Most POSIX-compliant shells should work with the
  current integration code, but some may need minor modifications.
